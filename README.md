        <p>Toji Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ甚とう爾じ Fushiguro Tōji?), born Toji Zenin (禪ぜん院いん甚とう爾じ Zen'in Tōji?) is a recurring character 
            in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He was a former member of the Zenin clan and the infamous assassin known as the Sorcerer Killer
             (術じゅつ師し殺ごろし Jutsushi Goroshi?), contracted by the Time Vessel Association among other groups throughout his time as a 
             non-curse user. He was also the father of Megumi Fushiguro and former enemy of Satoru Gojo. While working for the Star Religious 
             Group, Toji serves as the primary antagonist of the Gojo's Past Arc.

        <div id="test">The Inverted Spear of Heaven (天あまの逆さか鉾ほこ Ama no Sakahoko?) is a special grade cursed tool with the ability to 
            completely nullify cursed techniques on contact. It uses an imbued cursed technique fueled by foreign cursed energy. He used this
             to force the stoppage of the Infinity technique, completely bypassing the nearly impenetrable Limitless.
